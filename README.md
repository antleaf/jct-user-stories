## About User Stories

User stories are terse descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a **user** of the system. They follow this simple template:

For a user story to be valid and useful, it needs to have **all three** of those parts.



## To create a user story

1. Go to https://github.com/antleaf/jct-user-stories/issues
2. Create a new issue, with the the full user story as the title of the issue. Add any extra information you wish into the 'comment' field below.



## To view, label and categorise user stories

1. Go to https://github.com/antleaf/jct-user-stories/projects/1. User stories can be dragged to new columns, or can be labelled by clicking on the title of the user story.
